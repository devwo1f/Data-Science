# Data Science

Set of methodologies for taking in thousands of forms of data that are available to us today and using them to draw meaningful conclusions.

Data can be used to better describe the present or better predict the future.

> **“The ability to take data — to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it — that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades.” ~ *Hal Varian***

### What can Data do?

- Describe current state of an organisation or process
- Detect anomalous events
- Diagnose the cause of events and behaviours
- Predict future events

### Data Science Workflow

### Applications of Data Science

- Traditional Machine Learning
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Deep Learning

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.

**What do we need for Machine Learning?**

- A well defined question
    - *"What is the probability that this transaction is fraudulent"*
- A set of example data
    - *Old transactions labeled as “fraudulent” or “valid”*
- A new set of data to use our Algorithm on
    - *New credit card transactions*

### Internet of Things (IoT)

Refers to gadgets that aren’t standard computers but still have the ability to transmit data.

- Smart Watches
- Internet connected home security systems
- Electronic toll collection systems
- Building energy management systems

### Deep Learning

- Multiple layers of mini algorithms called neurons work together to draw complex conclusions
- Requires much more data, but also able to learn relationships that traditional models cannot
- Used in complex problems:
    - Image classification
    - Language learning/ Understanding

## Data Science Roles and Tools

There isn’t a single job in data science. Generally, there are 4:

- Data Engineer
    - Information Architects
    - Build data pipelines and storage solutions
    - Maintain Data Access
- Data Analyst
    - Perform simple Analysis that describe data
    - Create reports and dashboards to summarize data
    - Clean data for analysis
- Data Scientist
    - Versed in statistical methods
    - Run experiments and analysis for insights
    - Traditional machine learning
- Machine Learning Scientist
    - Predictions and extrapolations
    - Classifications
    - Deep Learning
        - Image processing
        - Natural language processing

| Data Engineer | Data Analyst | Data Scientist | Machine Learning Scientist |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Store and maintain data | Visualise and describe data | Gain insights from data | Predict with data |
| SQL+Java/Scala/Python | SQL+BI Tools+Spreadsheets | Python/R | Python/R |

## Sources of Data

| Company Data | Open Data |
| --- | --- |
| Collected by companies | Free, open data sources |
| Helps them make data-driven decisions | Can be used, shared, and built-on by anyone |

## Company data

We are generating vast amounts of data on a daily basis simply by surfing the internet, tracking a run, or paying by card in a shop. The companies behind these services that we use, collect this data internally. They use this to help them make data-driven decisions.

### Examples:

- Web events

    - Events
    - Timestamps
    - User Information
- Survey Data
    - Asking people for their opinions
    - Methods:
        - Face to Face interview
        - Online Questionaire
        - Focus group
- Customer Data

## Open Data

Free, open data sources

- Data API’s
    - Application Programming Interface
    - Request data over internet
    - Exaples:
        - Twitter API
        - Wikipedia API and many more...
- Public records
    - International organisations
        - eg.: World Bank, UN, WTO
    - National statistical offices
        - eg.: censuses, surveys
    - Government agencies
        - eg.: weather, environment, population
